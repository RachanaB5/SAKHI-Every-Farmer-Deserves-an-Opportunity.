# FoodFlow — From Every Harvest to Every Table

[![CI/CD](https://github.com/RachanaB5/SAKHI-Every-Farmer-Deserves-an-Opportunity./actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RachanaB5/SAKHI-Every-Farmer-Deserves-an-Opportunity./actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**A fresh-produce marketplace that connects smallholder farmers directly with households, restaurants
and community kitchens — with AI that assists and people who decide.** Farmers have **Sakhi** (ಸಖಿ / सखी),
a voice companion that takes them from sign-up to their first listing in Kannada, Hindi or English.

## The problem

Smallholder farmers sell through long chains of middlemen, so they get a small share of what buyers
pay — and perishable produce that doesn't sell in time is simply lost. Meanwhile households pay retail
markups for produce that is days old, restaurants juggle unreliable suppliers, and community kitchens
that feed people for free struggle to source affordably.

## What FoodFlow does

One marketplace, five apps — each built mobile-first at 360px and scaling up to a full desktop web app.

| Interface | Who | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Farmer** | Smallholders | List a harvest by **voice in Hindi, Kannada or English**; visual quality check on photos/video; indicative price advice from mandi data; orders, bulk offers, surplus rescue, traceable payouts. Whole UI in EN / हिन्दी / ಕನ್ನಡ. |
| **Household** | Consumers | **Snap or type a grocery list → smart basket** across nearby farms; checkout with per-farm delivery; live tracking; OTP doorstep handover; **subscriptions** (milk every morning, vegetables every Sunday). |
| **Restaurant / community kitchen** | Bulk buyers | Post urgent or recurring demand (form, voice or a procurement list); nearby farmers offer from live stock; **offers ranked** on cost, quantity, ETA, quality, distance and reliability; counter-offers; invoices. |
| **Admin** | Operations | Human **verification queue** for every harvest (AI flags, duplicate-photo detection, EXIF capture time); disputes and refunds; trust & safety; platform controls; live analytics. |
| **Delivery** | Riders | Runs, find order by code / QR / voice; a delivery is only complete when the **customer's OTP** is entered. |

### AI assists. People decide.

- **Visual checks, not certificates.** Quality scores describe what's visible in photos — never freshness or food safety.
- **Prices are indicative.** Numbers come from mandi reference prices and comparable listings; the model only rewords the explanation. The farmer sets the price.
- **People approve listings.** AI flags help the admin; a person decides what goes live.
- **OTP or it didn't happen.** Only the customer's one-time code marks an order delivered and releases a payout.
- **Works without a key.** Every AI feature has a deterministic fallback (multilingual parsers, an image heuristic, template text), labelled *Offline estimate* in the UI.

### Sakhi: ask by voice, in your language

A sprout button on every farmer screen opens **Sakhi** (ಸಖಿ / सखी), the farmer's voice companion: a side panel
on desktop, a bottom sheet on phones. Farmers speak or type in Kannada, Hindi, English or a mix:

- *"ಐವತ್ತು ಕಿಲೋ ಟೊಮೇಟೊ, ಕಿಲೋಗೆ ಇಪ್ಪತ್ತೈದು ರೂಪಾಯಿ"* → a harvest draft card, ready for a photo and review
- *"इस हफ्ते मैंने कितना कमाया?"* → confirmed order value, fee, estimated net, and what is paid vs. still pending
- *"tomato price 32 karo"*, *"show restaurant orders"*, *"book delivery for FF-ABC12"*, *"my payments"*

How it stays trustworthy:

- **Rules first.** A parser for spoken numbers (*sava do sau*, *ಎರಡೂವರೆ ಸಾವಿರ*), units, crop names and
  dates in all three languages handles most requests; the model is asked only when the rules are unsure,
  returns a schema-checked intent, and never touches the database. Without a key it works the same.
- **You see what was heard.** Speech becomes editable text first; low-confidence speech waits for *Use this*.
- **Nothing changes without a tap.** Publishing, price, stock, offers and deliveries show a card; the
  confirmation is signed, tied to the farmer, single-use and expires in five minutes. Publishing only sends
  the harvest to the admin queue.
- **Natural, honest voice.** Indian English first (names, places and crops pronounced the way farmers say
  them), then the most natural voice on the device (Edge's *Natural* voices, Google and Apple enhanced
  voices), in a female voice by default with a male one a tap away. Amounts are read the Indian way (*1 lakh 25 thousand*, *ಎರಡು ಸಾವಿರದ
  ಐನೂರು*), order codes letter by letter, and replies sentence by sentence. Replies are fixed templates with
  numbers from the database. Kannada is never read by an English voice: where a device has no Kannada voice
  (desktop Chrome), a Hindi voice reads it from Devanagari letters, and the panel says so.
- **A real Kannada voice.** Browsers rarely have one (desktop Chrome has none), so FoodFlow speaks Kannada
  itself: SYSPIN's open Kannada female voice from IISc Bangalore (CC BY 4.0), converted to ONNX and run on
  the server with onnxruntime-node (`/api/tts`). Names, *FoodFlow* and order codes inside Kannada lines are
  written in Kannada letters first, so they are pronounced, not skipped. Sakhi's fixed lines are recorded
  once and cached. Build it with `npm run voice:kannada` (see [Configuration](#configuration)); without
  it, a Kannada voice on the device is used, or a Hindi voice reads the Kannada and the panel says so.
- **Understands more than the options.** Shortcuts and slips pick the right answer (*"rest"*, *"resturant"*,
  *"the 2nd one"*, *"ಸಣ್ಣ"*, *"gpay and cash"*), and many more ways of saying yes and no (*"ಆಯ್ತು"*,
  *"हाँ जी"*, *"not now"*). Questions get answers instead of "I don't know": *"what is this app?"*,
  *"ಇದು ಉಚಿತವಾ?"*, *"पैसे कब मिलेंगे?"*, *"why do you need my number?"*, *"what are the options?"*. During
  sign-up Sakhi answers, then asks the pending question again, so a question is never saved as an answer.
- **From sign-up to first listing, by voice.** On seller sign-up, Sakhi asks every question out loud
  in Kannada, Hindi or English (the screens switch language too) and fills the form from the answers:
  *"ನನ್ನ ಹೆಸರು ರಮೇಶ್"*, *"ದೊಡ್ಡಬಳ್ಳಾಪುರ"* (district, nearest service area and PIN code follow), *"ಟೊಮೇಟೊ
  ಮತ್ತು ಈರುಳ್ಳಿ"*, *"about 200 kilo a week"*, *"UPI and cash"*. The PIN is typed, never spoken; a spoken
  "yes" then creates the account. Sakhi carries straight on in the farmer app, hands-free: the
  harvest, a photo, *"send it for review?"*, *"ಹೌದು"*. The first harvest is in the admin queue without the
  farmer touching a form.

## Try it in two minutes

Requires **Node.js 20.9+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RachanaB5/SAKHI-Every-Farmer-Deserves-an-Opportunity..git foodflow
cd foodflow
npm install
npm run setup   # creates .env, builds the SQLite database, seeds the Bengaluru pilot
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and press **Get started**: choose **Buyer** (household or restaurant) or
**Seller** and follow the sign-up. The seeded sample accounts below can sign in at `/login` (choose
"I already have an account") with their mobile number and PIN **1234**:

| Role | Phone | Persona |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Farmer | 9000000101 | Ramesh Gowda — Doddaballapur |
| Household | 9000000201 | Ananya Rao — Yelahanka |
| Restaurant | 9000000301 | The Green Ladle — Hebbal |
| Community kitchen | 9000000303 | Annapurna Community Kitchen |
| Admin | 9000000001 | Meera Krishnan |
| Delivery | 9000000401 | Imran Pasha |

**Sign in with Google** needs your own OAuth client: set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
and add `<NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL>/api/auth/google/callback` as an authorised redirect URI (see `.env.example`).
Members whose account has the same email, or who joined with Google, are signed straight in; new people choose
Buyer or Seller, add a mobile number and finish.

Your location in the top bar follows your device (the browser asks first) and each account can save several
addresses. Messages from the home page's contact form are stored in the `ContactMessage` table.

To start over with fresh sample data at any time: `npm run db:reset`.

**Pay with Razorpay** (optional, free in Test Mode): sign up at [razorpay.com](https://razorpay.com), switch the
dashboard to **Test Mode**, open *Account & Settings → API Keys → Generate Test Key*, put the two values in `.env`
as `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, and restart `npm run dev`. Checkout then opens Razorpay's own
payment window; pay with UPI ID `success@razorpay` or card `4100 2800 0000 1007` (any future expiry, any CVV).
Test Mode moves no real money. Without keys, checkout keeps its clearly labelled simulated payment. See
[Payments](#payments-razorpay).

### Demo script

1. **Farmer** (Ramesh) → *New harvest* → tap the mic and say *“50 kilo tamatar, aaj tode, 25 rupaye kilo”* (or type it) → check the parsed fields → add photos → see the visual score and price advice → *Send for verification*.
2. **Admin** → *Review* → approve Ramesh's batch; open Ravi's tomato batch, see the duplicate-photo flag, and reject it.
3. **Household** (Ananya) → *AI basket* → type or snap a grocery list → *Build my smart basket* → swap farms if you like → checkout with delivery. With Razorpay test keys set, *Pay* opens Razorpay: pay with `success@razorpay`, and the order page shows the Razorpay payment id; cancel the order and the refund id appears.
4. **Farmer** → *Orders* → mark packed → *Book delivery*. **Delivery** (Imran) → open the run → *Picked up* → ask the household for the OTP (shown on their order page) → enter it → delivered. The farmer's *Payments* shows the settlement as pending.
5. **Restaurant** (The Green Ladle) → *Post* an urgent 50 kg onion demand → as farmers, make two offers → back as the restaurant, the offers are ranked → accept one.
6. **Farmer** → *Surplus* → a slow-selling spinach lot is flagged → offer it to Annapurna's open demand in one tap.
7. **Admin** → *Overview* shows the new orders and kg rescued; *Trust* and *Controls* show flags, commission, service areas and payouts.
8. **New farmer, by voice** → *Get started* → *Seller* → choose ಕನ್ನಡ → *Guide me by voice* → answer each question out loud (or type) and watch the form fill in → type a PIN → say *"ಹೌದು"* → in the farmer app say *"ಐವತ್ತು ಕಿಲೋ ಟೊಮೇಟೊ, ಕಿಲೋಗೆ ಇಪ್ಪತ್ತೈದು ರೂಪಾಯಿ"* → add a photo → *"ಹೌದು"*. As Ramesh, tap the sprout button and ask *"ಈ ವಾರ ಎಷ್ಟು ಗಳಿಸಿದೆ?"* or *"show restaurant orders"*.

Every step works at a 360px phone width and on desktop.

### How the hard parts work

| Concern | Approach | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No double-selling** | Stock moves only through a conditional `UPDATE … WHERE availableQty >= qty` inside a transaction; a whole order reserves or nothing does. Cancel releases, handover commits. | `lib/inventory.ts` |
| **Order states** | Explicit transition table; every move is a conditional update on the current status, so racing actions can't skip a step. | `lib/orders/state.ts` |
| **Handover OTP** | Stored as HMAC(secret, delivery, nonce, code); 15-minute expiry; 5 attempts counted atomically; regenerating rotates the nonce and invalidates old pickup QRs. Handover is idempotent and creates exactly one settlement. | `lib/otp.ts`, `lib/delivery/handover.ts` |
| **Who pays what** | Buyer pays subtotal + delivery fee (free retail delivery from ₹499). Commission (default 5%, admin-set) is withheld from the farmer. Courier cost is ₹15 + ₹1.5/km, capped at ₹60; the farmer covers any shortfall over the buyer's fee but never more than 15% of the order. | `lib/fees.ts` |
| **Offer ranking** | Cost as a ratio to the cheapest delivered price, plus quantity, ETA, visual quality, distance and reliability (30/20/15/15/10/10); ×0.6 if it misses the deadline. The model may only explain, not reorder. | `lib/ranking.ts` |
| **Smart basket** | Per item, scores nearby listings on price, ETA, freshness and visual quality, with a bonus for farms that cover several items (fewer deliveries). | `lib/basket.ts` |
| **Surplus rescue** | At risk when sell-through is below the threshold after the minimum age, or the harvest has used most of its shelf life. Rescue offers go to open community-kitchen demand at the buyer's target, never below 70% of the mandi rate. | `lib/surplus.ts` |
| **Payments** | Razorpay Checkout when keys are set: the server prices the cart and opens a Razorpay order; orders are created only after the payment's signature, order, amount and capture are confirmed with Razorpay. Verify and webhook race safely (one claims, the other reads). A farm that ran out after payment, a cancellation or a refunded dispute is refunded through Razorpay's API. | `lib/payments/` |
| **Subscriptions** | IST slot scheduling; a run claims the plan with a conditional update so overlapping schedulers place one order; falls back to the same farmer, then any farm, when stock runs out. | `lib/subscriptions.ts` |
| **Trust & safety** | SHA-256 duplicate-photo detection across batches, complaint-rate flags, price outliers vs. the mandi reference. Flags only — suspension and pausing are human actions, audit-logged. | `lib/trust.ts` |

### Payments (Razorpay)

| | With Razorpay keys | Without keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buyer checkout | Razorpay Checkout (UPI, cards, netbanking, wallets) | Simulated: authorise → reserve stock → capture, labelled *demo* |
| When orders appear | Only after Razorpay confirms the payment | Immediately |
| Cancellation, stock-out after payment, refunded dispute | Refunded through Razorpay; the refund id shows on the order | Marked refunded (simulated) |
| Subscription runs and accepted bulk offers | Simulated (recurring mandates are not integrated) | Simulated |
| Farmer payouts (settlements) | Recorded and released by admins; no money is sent out (RazorpayX payouts are not integrated) | Same |

The flow: `POST /api/payments/razorpay/order` prices the cart and stores it as a `PaymentIntent`.
Razorpay Checkout opens in the browser, and `POST /api/payments/razorpay/verify` checks Razorpay's
HMAC signature, fetches the payment from Razorpay (right order, full amount, captured, capturing it if it
was only authorised) and places one order per farm. `POST /api/payments/razorpay/webhook` does the same
for a buyer who closed the tab right after paying; set it up in the Razorpay dashboard with the events
`payment.authorized`, `payment.captured`, `payment.failed` and `order.paid`, and put its secret in
`RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (Razorpay can't reach `localhost`, so use a tunnel or a deployed URL).
Card and UPI details are typed into Razorpay's window; FoodFlow stores only Razorpay's order, payment and
refund ids.

| `npm run setup` | First run: creates `.env` with a random secret, applies migrations, seeds demo data |
| `npm run dev` | Development server on http://localhost:3000 |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build and server |
| `npm test` | Vitest suite — inventory races, OTP rules, fee maths, ranking, subscriptions, parsers, Razorpay payments (against a stand-in API) |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` | ESLint (zero warnings) and TypeScript |
| `npm run db:firestore:import` | Dry-run a copy of Prisma records into Firestore; add `-- --write` to import |
| `npm run db:reset` | Recreate the database and reseed the demo |
| `npm run db:studio` | Browse the data in Prisma Studio |
| `npm run voice:kannada` | Download SYSPIN's open Kannada voice and convert it for the server (one time: a 333 MB download, 115 MB kept on disk) |
| `node scripts/screenshots.mjs --role FARMER /farmer` | Screenshot pages at 360 / 768 / 1280 px and flag overflow and console errors |

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`npm run setup` does this for you).

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | `file:./dev.db` locally; a Postgres URL in production |
| `DIRECT_URL` | no | Direct (unpooled) Postgres URL for Neon / Supabase |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | yes | 32+ random characters; signs sessions, pickup QRs and OTP hashes |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | no | Enables the Gemini model; without it every AI feature uses its fallback |
| `GEMINI_MODEL`, `AI_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | Model name and per-call timeout before falling back |
| `STORAGE_DRIVER` | no | `local` (default) writes uploads to `public/uploads`; falls back to inline on read-only hosts |
| `CRON_SECRET` | no | Lets a scheduler call `/api/subscriptions/run-due` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STT_PROVIDER` | no | `browser` (default) uses the browser's speech recognition for Sakhi. `server` is reserved for a self-hosted Indic model and is not implemented yet |
| `DEMO_MODE` | no | One-tap sign-in as seeded accounts (API only). Off in production unless set to `true`; keep it off on a live site |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` | no | Firebase web app configuration for the modular client SDK |
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | no | Firebase project used by the Admin SDK and import script |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | no | Server-only service account JSON; alternatively configure Application Default Credentials |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | no | Turn on Razorpay checkout and refunds. Test keys (`rzp_test_…`) are free and move no real money |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | no | Verifies `/api/payments/razorpay/webhook`, which places orders if a buyer closes the tab after paying |
| `KANNADA_VOICE_DIR` | no | Where Sakhi's Kannada voice model lives (default `models/kn-female`, built by `npm run voice:kannada`, which needs Python with `torch`, `onnx` and `onnxruntime`). Without it Kannada uses the device's voices |

### Firebase authentication and Firestore migration

The sign-in page supports Firebase Google sign-in, email/password accounts and passwordless email
links. New Firebase accounts continue through the existing role-specific onboarding and get a
Firestore user profile plus an authentication link. Existing Prisma users can link their account
when they sign in with the same verified email. Phone/PIN and the existing marketplace remain
available during the data migration.

In Firebase Console, enable Google, Email/Password and Email link sign-in, create a Firestore
database, and copy the web app settings into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` entries in `.env`. For
server-side Firestore access, set
`FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and configure a service account through `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` or
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. Never expose service-account credentials to the browser.

Firestore is configured for server-only access by default (`firestore.rules` denies client reads and
writes). Deploy those rules before importing data. The import command is copy-only and leaves the
SQLite/Postgres source unchanged. For a PostgreSQL source, first generate the Prisma client for
PostgreSQL with the existing `npm run db:postgres` command and set `DATABASE_URL` to that database.

```bash
npm run db:firestore:import
npm run db:firestore:import -- --write
```

The first command reports per-model record counts without writing. The second copies records to
collections named after their Prisma models, preserving foreign keys as IDs. User PIN hashes and
Google IDs are kept separately in the server-only `authCredentials` collection instead of the
`User` documents. You can rerun the importer safely to overwrite imported records, or limit it to
one model with `-- --model=User --write`.

This importer is a copy-only bridge; it does not cut marketplace reads/writes over from Prisma, nor
does it convert PIN hashes into Firebase passwords. Firebase Auth profiles are linked as users sign
in, while app data continues to use the source database. Keep the source database until every
Firestore-backed data flow has been migrated and verified.

## Deploy (Vercel + Postgres)

1. Create a Postgres database (Neon, Supabase or Vercel Postgres).
2. Import the repository in Vercel and set `DATABASE_URL` (and `DIRECT_URL` if your provider pools
   connections), `SESSION_SECRET`, optionally `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `CRON_SECRET`.
3. Deploy. `vercel.json` runs `npm run vercel-build`, which switches the Prisma schema to Postgres,
   pushes the schema and builds.
4. Seed the demo once from your machine:

   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://…"      # the same URL as on Vercel
   npm run db:postgres && npx prisma db push && npm run db:seed
   git checkout prisma/schema.prisma && unset DATABASE_URL && npx prisma generate   # back to SQLite
   ```

The included cron runs due subscriptions daily at 04:00 IST (the Hobby plan's limit); for
15-minute runs, point any external scheduler at `/api/subscriptions/run-due` with
`Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`. Live updates fall back to polling on serverless hosts, and
uploaded media is stored inline when the filesystem is read-only.

## Project structure

```
app/                 routes — one folder per role (farmer, shop, bulk, admin, delivery) + /api
components/          UI by role, plus shell, motion, 3D (three/) and landing sections
lib/                 domain logic, AI layer, auth, i18n (en / hi / kn), validators
prisma/              schema, migration and the deterministic demo seed
scripts/             setup, Postgres switch, responsive screenshot QA
tests/               Vitest suites (run against a throwaway SQLite database)
```

## CI/CD

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every pull request and every push to
`main`:

- **Lint, types & tests** — ESLint, `tsc` (with Next route types), the Vitest suite, a check that
  `prisma/migrations` matches `schema.prisma`, a fresh migrate + seed, and Postgres schema validation.
- **Production build** — `npm run build`, with the Next.js build cache persisted between runs.
- **Deploy** — pushes to `main` that pass both jobs are deployed to Vercel production (built on
  Vercel via `npm run vercel-build`).

To turn on deploys, add these repository secrets (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**):

| Secret | Where to find it |
| --- | --- |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Vercel → Account Settings → Tokens |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | `orgId` in `.vercel/project.json` after running `npx vercel link` |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `projectId` in the same file |

Without them, CI still runs and the deploy job is skipped. The app's runtime variables
(`DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) stay in the Vercel
project settings. If the Vercel project is also connected to this repo through Vercel's Git
integration, add `"git": { "deploymentEnabled": { "main": false } }` to `vercel.json` so `main`
deploys only after CI passes. Without that, each push deploys twice.
